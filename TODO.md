# TODO

## Small

## Medium

- [ ] [App] No restore flow for S3 backups (upload only) : retrieving a tarball
      and unpacking it back into a bind mount or a named volume is still manual.
- [ ] [App] Compose import ignores `build:` : a compose service built from a
      local Dockerfile is imported as a service that then needs its Source tab
      pointed at a git repo by hand.
- [ ] [App] Cron jobs run on the local Docker daemon only : `runOneOff` takes a
      remote connection but nothing passes one, so an image job can't be
      targeted at a Remote Host, and a run's output is only visible after it
      finishes (no live tail).
- [ ] Add security policies for an instance: require passkey, 2fa etc.. with
      passkey and 2fa support on auth pages.

## Large

- [ ] [Docker] Security scanning
- [ ] [SDKs] Terraform/Pulumi providers
- [ ] [SDKs] Github Actions & Gitlab CI presets to deploy easily (deterministic
      or not, should be a settings if the user wants latest or only tagged)
