  Use when asked to audit or improve the developer experience of this repo, or
  after a change to tooling (package.json scripts, biome/markdownlint/prettier
  config, tsconfigs, pre-commit, CI workflows, compose files, .env.example,
  .agents/skills, .claude/agents). Walks the contributor path end to end — fresh
  clone → install → docker compose up → migrate → dev → test → check/lint → PR
  CI, and fixes the friction it finds: documented commands that don't exist or
  don't work, scripts nobody documents, .env.example drifting from config.ts,
  local gates that don't match CI, contributor notes (.agents/notes, CLAUDE.md,
  AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md) contradicting the code, skills/agents pointing at
  files that moved, dead dependencies and scripts, unclear startup errors, slow
  or flaky tests, and oversized Svelte files (over 400 lines) that need
  splitting into components. Not for operator-facing docs/ (docs-audit), JSDoc
  (doc-comments) or reviewing a diff against conventions (repo-gate).

# DevEx

Homerun has one contributor and a lot of AI sessions working on it. Every minute
a session spends re-deriving a command, tripping over a stale note, or debugging
a local gate that passes while CI fails is wasted. Your job is to walk the
contributor path the way a new session would, find where it hurts, and fix it.

Read CLAUDE.md first. Its "How to work here" rules apply to you: fix things in
one go, no plans, no severity tiers, out-of-scope findings go in `TODO.md`.

## What to check

### 1. Commands are real and documented once

- Every script in `package.json` is listed in CLAUDE.md's Commands block with an
  accurate one-line description, and every command listed there exists.
  Currently undocumented scripts are a finding
  (`jq -r '.scripts|keys[]' package.json` vs the Commands block).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/notes/testing.md`,
  `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `tests/*/README.md` don't cite commands, flags
  or paths that no longer exist. Grep every `bun run <x>` they mention.
- Run the cheap ones for real (`bun run check`, `bun run lint`, `bun run test`,
  `bun run gen`) and read the output: warnings, noisy logs, deprecation notices
  and slow steps are findings too.

### 2. Fresh-clone setup works

- `.env.example` covers every env var `src/lib/config.ts` (and
  `internal/worker/config.go`/`internal/homerun/config.go` for the sub-projects
  that read env vars of their own) reads, with no leftovers for vars that are
  gone. Compare against the real `.env` only for key names, never copy or print
  its values.
- `compose.yaml` / `compose.dev.yaml` match what CLAUDE.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
  say local dev needs (Traefik + Postgres, ports, network name).
- `preinstall` / `prepare` hooks, `patches/`, `bunfig.toml` and `.npmrc` do what
  their names suggest and don't fail on a clean machine.
- The app's failure when Postgres or the Docker socket is missing is a clear,
  actionable message, not a stack trace (`src/hooks.server.ts`, `config.ts`).

### 3. Local gates match CI

- `.github/workflows/code_quality.yaml`, `pull_request.yaml` and `e2e.yaml` run
  the same commands a contributor runs locally. A CI step with no local
  equivalent, or a local gate CI skips, is a finding.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` hooks exist, run, and don't duplicate or contradict
  `bun run lint` (formatter disagreements between biome, prettier and tailwint
  in particular).
- Tool versions pinned in CI (Bun, Postgres image, Playwright) match what the
  repo expects locally.

### 4. Tooling isn't fighting itself

- Overlapping formatters/linters (`biome.json`, `.prettierrc`,
  `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`, `_typos.toml`, `.editorconfig`) agree on the same
  files, or have clearly separate scopes. A listed-but-unwired tool is removed
  from `package.json` or wired up.
- `tsconfig*.json` include lists cover every TS file some gate should check;
  nothing falls between `svelte-check`'s scope and
  `tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.scripts.json` (both run inside
  `bun run check`).
- `.vscode/extensions.json` and `settings.json` recommend the tools the repo
  actually uses.
- Dependencies in `package.json` that nothing imports, and scripts nothing
  calls. Grep before declaring something dead; config files and CI reference
  packages too.
- Stray build/scratch output tracked or not ignored (`tmp/`, `dist/`,
  `test-results/`, `.DS_Store`): check `.gitignore` and `git ls-files`.

### 5. Contributor notes and AI tooling are true

- `.agents/notes/*.md` claims about file paths, class/method names, tables and
  flows: spot-check every backticked path and symbol exists
  (`grep -o '\`[^\`]*\.\(ts\|svelte\|md\|yaml\)\`'`), and fix the ones that
  moved. CLAUDE.md's notes table lists every note file and nothing else.
- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` steps still work against the current code, and
  every skill has its `.claude/skills/` symlink.
- `.claude/agents/*.md` reference real scripts, paths and sibling agents, and
  CLAUDE.md's AI-assisted development section lists every agent and skill.

### 6. The inner loop is fast

- Time `bun run check`, `bun run lint` and `bun run test`. Anything unreasonably
  slow (a test with a real sleep, a check that runs twice, a sequential chain
  that could be parallel) is a finding.
- Tests that are flaky or order-dependent: run `bun run test` twice and compare.

### 7. No Svelte file is too long to hold in your head

- List every `.svelte` file over 400 lines, longest first:

  ```bash
  find src -name '*.svelte' -not -path '*/components/ui/*' \
    | xargs wc -l | sort -rn | awk '$1 > 400'
  ```

  Every hit is a finding; an 1100-line `+page.svelte` is unmaintainable no
  matter how tidy each block is.

- Split each one along its natural seams (a wizard step, a tab-like panel, a
  dialog, a repeated row editor, a sidebar card):
  - A piece that another page also renders, or clearly could, goes to
    `src/lib/components/` as a reusable component. Check for an existing one
    first, the `ui-consistency` agent's list of shared components is a start.
  - A piece only this route uses goes next to the route, as a
    `PascalCase.svelte` file (or `components/` subfolder) in the route's own
    directory. SvelteKit only treats `+`-prefixed files as routes, so these are
    ordinary components.
  - Split components are non-route code: type their `$props()` with an explicit
    `interface Props`, use `$bindable()` for state the parent owns, and pass
    `form`/`data` slices down rather than the whole object. The route file
    itself keeps its untyped `const { data, form } = $props();`.
  - Keep behaviour identical: same field `name`s, same DOM order inside a
    `<form>`, same `class:hidden` (not `{#if}`) where the original relied on
    nodes staying mounted. Run the route's e2e spec after splitting.
- Aim for every resulting file under 400 lines. A file that stays over after a
  sensible split (one genuinely long, flat form) goes in the report with the
  reason, not in a contortion.

## How to act

- Split oversized Svelte files (area 7) directly; that's a fix, not a `TODO.md`
  entry.
- Fix clear-cut problems directly: wrong/missing docs for commands,
  `.env.example` drift, broken note paths, missing symlinks, dead scripts,
  gitignore gaps, CI/local mismatches with an obvious correct side.
- Anything that changes app behaviour, needs a design call, or is big (replacing
  a formatter, restructuring CI) goes in `TODO.md` as one line with enough
  context to act on, then carry on.
- Follow the repo conventions for anything you edit: no code comments except
  JSDoc on functions, `bun run check` and `bun run lint` clean at the end.
- Never run git write operations. Never print secrets from `.env`.

## Verify

- `bun run check` and `bun run lint` exit 0.
- Every command you changed or documented actually runs.
- `bunx markdownlint-cli2` clean over every markdown file you touched.

## Report

Group by the seven areas above: what you fixed (file + one line), what you added
to `TODO.md`, and the timings from area 6. If an area had nothing wrong, say so
in one line.
