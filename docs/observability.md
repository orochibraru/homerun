# Observability

The **Observability** tab is where a service tells you how it's doing. It has
two sections: **Monitoring**, its traffic, response time, error rate, uptime and
resource use over a range, and **Events**, its uptime probes, live logs, failed
deploys and the errors Homerun logged about it.

## Monitoring

Pick a range, **Today** (from midnight in your browser's time zone), **7 days**,
**30 days**, **12 months** or **All time**, and the section shows:

- **Requests**, **Avg response time**, **Error rate** (4xx and 5xx responses)
  and **Bandwidth served**, from Traefik's own metrics. Homerun reads them once
  a minute and keeps what each service served that minute; a minute without
  requests stores nothing. The response time is how long Traefik waited on the
  service, so it leaves out the visitor's own network. Only publicly routed
  services have traffic: a service reached only over the Docker network never
  goes through Traefik.
- **Uptime (public)** and **Uptime (network)**: the share of
  [uptime probes](#uptime) that passed in the range, with their average latency.
- **Avg CPU** and **Avg memory**, with their peaks, from the per-minute resource
  samples.

Each number also shows how it moved against the previous period of the same
length: yesterday up to the same time for **Today**, the 7, 30 or 365 days
before for the others (**All time** has nothing to compare with). The change is
green when it's good news, red when it isn't (a slower response time, a higher
error rate, lower uptime, more CPU or memory) and grey when it's neither (more
requests or bandwidth). Error rate and uptime move in percentage points, the
rest by a relative share.

Below them, charts of requests, response time, CPU and memory over the range;
hover one to read a single point. Everything is kept for a year, so **All time**
reaches back at most that far. Traffic starts being recorded when an instance
runs this version: Homerun turns Traefik's metrics on by itself (an entrypoint
inside the Traefik container, never published), which restarts Traefik once.

## Stacks and the whole instance

The same view exists one level up. A stack's **Monitoring** tab covers its
services and every substack's: requests, response time, error rate, bandwidth
and uptime summed over all of them, and CPU and memory summed minute by minute,
so the peak is the stack's real peak rather than the sum of each service's.
**Monitoring** in the sidebar covers every service on the instance, with this
host's own CPU and memory instead of the sum of the services'. Both add a **By
service** table, busiest first, that links to each service's own monitoring.

## Uptime

Every minute Homerun probes each deployed service two ways, and the tab draws
the recent results as two heartbeat strips with an uptime percentage, latency,
and the reason for the latest failure plus hints for fixing it:

- **From the network**: the container's own port, reached over the Docker
  network. It runs the service's [healthcheck command](services.md#health) when
  it has one, opens a TCP connection for a database image, and makes an HTTP
  request otherwise.
- **From its hostname**: the public hostname Traefik publishes
  (`<slug>.<base domain>` or the service's main domain). It's skipped for a
  service that isn't DNS-resolvable, and while the base domain is a loopback
  address like `localhost`, since probing it from this machine proves nothing.

Over HTTP any response under 500 counts as up, a 401 or 404 included, and a 5xx
counts as down. Probing pauses while Homerun disrupts routing on purpose, during
its own boot, a Traefik restart and a self-update, so those don't show up as
outages.

A probe that goes down fires the **Service down** event on any
[notification channel](notifications.md) subscribed to it, and **Service
recovered** once it has stayed up for 15 minutes. A service that keeps falling
over and coming back alerts once, not on every cycle. Results are kept for a
week; **Clear heartbeats** empties the history. Uptime also feeds
[status pages](status-pages.md).

Probing is on by default for every service except databases and caches
(Postgres, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis-compatibles, RabbitMQ, Memcached),
which have nothing public to watch; turn it on for one of those if you want a
TCP check. **Turn off** in the Uptime panel's header stops both probes for that
service (the panel then says so), **Turn on** resumes them; the REST API takes
the same switch as `uptimeEnabled` on `PATCH /api/v1/services/:id`.

## Logs

The log panel live-streams a running container's stdout/stderr straight from the
browser: the server pushes each line as the container writes it over a long-
lived HTTP response, no polling and no WebSocket (SvelteKit 2 has no WebSocket
route API; nothing here needs a client-to-server socket anyway). A shorter tail
of the same viewer is on the Overview tab once a service has deployed at least
once, so recent output is visible without switching tabs.

## Errors

Below the logs, **Failed deployments** and **Application errors** (persisted
warn/error-level app log lines that mention this service) sit alongside a
"container currently down" banner when the container has crashed. A deploy that
reaches running hides the errors logged before it, and **Clear errors** does the
same by hand; a note says how many are hidden and what cleared them, with a link
to show them again. If a service's container was removed outside Homerun (e.g. a
manual `docker rm`), the tab shows a distinct "container is gone" banner with a
**Resolve** button instead: click it to clear the stale reference so the service
goes back to its normal never-deployed state and Deploy works again.

## Terminal

A real terminal into the live container, from the browser, only available while
the service is `running`. It runs `bash` when the image has it and `sh`
otherwise, under a TTY sized to the tab, so colours, tab completion, Ctrl-C and
full-screen tools like `vim`, `top` or `htop` work as they would over SSH. It
follows the app's light/dark theme. Open/close events are logged; individual
keystrokes/commands are not (that's a deliberate scope cut, not an oversight,
raw TTY bytes don't map cleanly to discrete commands anyway).

Leaving the tab (closing it, navigating away, or 15 minutes with no input or
output) ends the session and kills the shell along with everything started from
it, background jobs included: they get `SIGHUP`, then `SIGKILL` a second later
if they're still there. Run something meant to outlive the session as a
[cron job](scheduling.md#cron-jobs) or in the image itself, not from the
terminal.
