# Authentication providers

The **Authentication** page (Administration, admin-only) is where sign-in
methods are configured for the whole instance. It has four tabs: **Sign-in**
(built-in accounts, preferred methods and requirements), **Providers**, **Sign
in with Homerun** (see [Sign in with Homerun](sign-in-with-homerun.md)) and
**Protected apps** (every service behind the login wall and the methods it
accepts).

- **Built-in authentication** is Homerun's own email and password accounts,
  managed on the Users page. It's always available for the dashboard.
- **Emailed sign-in** lets people sign in without a password, with a 6-digit
  code or a one-time link sent to their account's address (see below).
- **OAuth / OIDC providers** are any standards-compliant provider, and you can
  configure **as many as you like**. The **Providers** tab lists them the same
  way Services does: **Add provider** opens its own page, and each one has a
  detail page for editing and removal (removal asks you to type the provider's
  id first). One-click presets fill in the discovery URL shape, scopes and PKCE
  default for Pocket ID, Keycloak, Authelia, Logto, Authentik, Zitadel and
  Kanidm; replace the `{placeholders}` with your own hostname and add the client
  id and secret from the OAuth app you registered there. Any other OIDC provider
  works from the "Blank" option. Each provider has a **Display name** shown on
  the sign-in button and everywhere it's listed, separate from its **Provider
  id**, which is the lowercase machine name baked into the redirect URI and
  fixed once created. Leaving a client secret blank when editing keeps the one
  already stored.

Register `<your-homerun-url>/api/v1/auth/callback/<provider id>` as the redirect
URI on the provider's side. The Authentication page prints the exact URL to use.

The same page has three instance-wide switches:

- **Emailed sign-in**: **Email me a code** (on by default) and **Email me a
  sign-in link** (off by default), each switched on or off separately. Both need
  SMTP (Settings → Email); until it's configured the section says so and neither
  is offered anywhere. See [Emailed codes and links](#emailed-codes-and-links).

- **Preferred sign-in methods** picks among password, passkey and each enabled
  provider. The sign-in page is email-first (see below), so this no longer
  reorders a list of buttons: with passkey preferred, the page prompts for one
  as soon as it opens instead of only offering autofill; with a provider
  preferred, an account linked to it is sent straight there once you enter its
  email, skipping the extra click. Pick none and the page just falls back to
  whatever's available for that account.
- **Sign-in requirements**: **Require two-factor authentication** and **Require
  a passkey**. They apply to every account, admins included. Anyone who doesn't
  meet one is sent to a setup page on their next visit and can't use the
  dashboard until they've enrolled. API keys and CLI tokens aren't affected.

## OAuth / OIDC login

Configured per-provider from the Authentication page, not env vars: any
OIDC-compatible provider via a discovery URL, client ID/secret, and scopes.
Applies live once saved, no restart. The discovery URL is validated before
saving specifically because a broken one used to be able to lock the whole
instance out (see [Configuration](configuration.md#a-note-on-lockout)).

**Client authentication** on each provider controls how the client id and secret
are sent when exchanging the login for a token. _Automatic_ reads your
provider's own discovery document and uses the HTTP Basic header when it's
offered, which is what OpenID Connect defaults to. Override it only if sign-in
fails with **`invalid_client`** while the credentials are correct — that means
the client you registered expects the other method.

**Set the Dashboard URL (Settings → General) before you add a provider, and keep
it accurate.** An OAuth provider only accepts a redirect URI you registered with
it in advance, so Homerun sends the one built from the Dashboard URL — that's
the URL the Authentication page shows you. Two things follow:

- If the Dashboard URL doesn't match how you actually reach Homerun, sign-in
  fails with something like _"The redirect_uri '…' is not registered for this
  client"_. Change the Dashboard URL to match rather than registering a second
  URI with your provider.
- Single sign-on has to begin and end on that same address. If you open Homerun
  on some other hostname, the sign-in page will point you at the configured one
  instead of offering provider buttons that can't work, and the login-wall
  sign-in screen redirects there on its own. Email and password sign-in works
  from any address.

The sign-in page asks for your email first: enter one with no password set and
already linked to a provider, and it's offered there as a "Continue with …"
button (or you're sent straight to it, see Preferred sign-in methods above); any
other email gets a password field with every enabled provider offered below it.
Every enabled provider also becomes selectable as a per-app sign-in method on
the [login wall](login-wall.md). Saving takes effect immediately, without a
restart.

## Emailed codes and links

After entering their email, anyone with an account can pick **Email me a code**
or **Email me a sign-in link** below the password field (or below the provider
buttons for a single sign-on account). An account with no password and no linked
provider, such as a client who accepted an invite with emailed codes, skips
straight to it: entering the email sends the code.

- **Codes** are 6 digits, expire after 10 minutes and allow five tries. Paste
  the code or type it; the form signs in as soon as all six digits are there.
  **Send a new code** replaces the old one, with a 30-second wait between sends.
- **Links** expire after 10 minutes and work once, in whichever browser opens
  them. A link opens a Homerun page with a **Sign in as …** button rather than
  signing in straight away, so a mail filter that fetches links can't use it up.
  A link isn't offered on the **Sign in with Homerun** screen of an app, since
  that flow has to finish in the tab it started in.

Neither can create an account: an email Homerun doesn't know simply gets no
mail, and the page doesn't say whether the address exists. Everything else works
as with a password: the login wall and **Sign in with Homerun** send you back
where you came from, an account with two-factor authentication is still asked
for its authenticator code, and the instance's sign-in requirements still apply.
Signing in with a code or link also marks the account's email as verified, and
ends a directly created account's pending password setup (it can keep signing in
with codes).

## Locked out after a typo?

[Base domain and Dashboard URL](configuration.md#base-domain-vs-dashboard-url)
are two different settings. If a wrong one means the dashboard's domain no
longer reaches Homerun, open it on the server's IP and port instead
(`http://<server IP>:3000` for a standard install) and fix the setting from
there. Homerun always accepts sign-ins on its own IP address, whatever the
domain settings say. That works as long as `ORIGIN` in `.env` isn't an `https`
address, which the installer doesn't set.

## Signing out

Signing out of Homerun signs you out of Homerun only. If you also want it to end
your session at the identity provider (which sends you to that provider's logout
page), turn on **Sign out of the provider too** on that provider's page. It's
off by default.

## Connecting a provider to an existing account

Signing in with a provider whose email already belongs to a local account is
refused, on purpose: matching an email address doesn't prove the two accounts
are the same person.

If you hit that, the page you land on does the work for you. Signed in, it
offers **Link \<provider\> to this account** and **Sign out**. Signed out, it
gives you an email and password box right there — sign in and the provider is
connected in the same step, no trip through the sign-in page and your profile.

You can also manage this any time from **Profile → Security → Connected
accounts**, which lists every enabled provider with Connect/Disconnect.
Disconnect stays unavailable until you have a password set, so you can't remove
your last way in.
