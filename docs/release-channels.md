# Release channels

Release channels split one git service into two environments, for the common "a
branch is canary, a tag is stable" release model:

- **Stable** is the service itself. It deploys when a tag matching the **tag
  pattern** (`v*` by default) is pushed, building that tag.
- **Canary** is a companion service Homerun creates and manages,
  `<slug>-canary`. It deploys on every push to the **canary branch** (the
  service's own branch by default).

They're off by default, and nothing about a service changes until you turn them
on.

## Turning them on

Open a git service's **Channels** tab, tick **Enable release channels**, and
optionally change:

- **Canary branch**: the branch whose pushes deploy the canary.
- **Stable tag pattern**: a glob. `*` matches any run of characters (slashes
  included), `?` exactly one; everything else is literal. `v*` matches `v1.2.0`
  and `v2.0.0-rc.1`; `v[0-9]*` doesn't work, there are no character classes.
- **Canary domain**: a domain for the canary, e.g. `canary.example.com`. Without
  one it answers at `<slug>-canary.<baseDomain>`.

Saving creates the canary and deploys it from the canary branch. From the CLI:

```bash
homerun services channels enable <service> --branch main --tags 'v*' --canary-domain canary.example.com
homerun services channels status <service>
homerun services channels disable <service>
```

or `PATCH /api/v1/services/{serviceId}/channels` with
`{"enabled": true, "branch": "main", "tagPattern": "v*"}` (see
[API & CLI](api-and-cli.md)).

## What the canary is

The canary copies the service's build settings, env vars, resources,
healthcheck, stack, icon and login wall, and gets them again before every canary
deploy, so change settings on the stable service and the next canary deploy
picks them up. It doesn't copy volumes, domains, cron schedules or status
checks. It's a normal service you can open (its Source tab says whose canary it
is), and it's listed under its parent in the services list, on the stack page
and in the dependency tree, like
[pull request previews](pull-request-previews.md).

Turning channels off, or deleting the service, deletes the canary: container,
DNS records and all.

## How pushes are routed

With channels on, the service's webhook routes every push:

- A pushed tag matching the pattern deploys **stable** at that tag. The tag
  becomes the service's git ref, so a later manual deploy rebuilds the same tag.
- A push to the canary branch deploys **canary**.
- Anything else is ignored, including pushes to the stable service's own branch:
  its **Deploy on push** setting doesn't apply while channels are on.

Until the first matching tag, stable keeps building whatever ref it had.

Turning channels on re-registers the webhook. GitHub, Gitea and Bitbucket
already send tag pushes as push events; on GitLab the hook also gets **Tag push
events**, so tick it on a hook you added by hand. GitHub doesn't send push
events for tags when more than three are pushed at once.

When the provider can't reach Homerun, the canary branch is polled every two
minutes like [deploy on push](deploy-on-push.md) does. Tags aren't polled:
stable only deploys from a webhook, or by hand.

## Deploying by hand

The Channels tab has a **Deploy** button per environment. From the CLI or the
API:

```bash
homerun deploy <service> --environment canary
homerun deploy <service> --environment stable
```

`POST /api/v1/services/{serviceId}/deploy` takes `{"environment": "canary"}`
too. Stable rebuilds its current ref, the last tag it deployed.

## Environments in the history

Every deployment records the environment it deployed: `production` for a normal
service and a stable one, `canary`, or `preview` for a pull request preview. The
Revisions tab and the instance-wide **Deployments** page show it as a badge, and
the Deployments page filters on it. The API's deployment and revision shapes
carry it as `environment`.
