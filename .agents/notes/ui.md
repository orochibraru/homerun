# UI, design system, components

Homerun reference notes, loaded on demand rather than every session. `CLAUDE.md`
holds the rules that always apply plus an index of the sibling notes in this
directory. These sections were split out of that file, so a "see X below/above"
in the text below may now point at a section living in a sibling note rather
than in this one.

## Design system and theming (`src/routes/layout.css`)

One file owns the whole visual language : the palette, the radius scale, the
fonts, and the four custom Tailwind v4 `@utility` definitions every surface is
built from. Nothing under `src/routes`/`src/lib` should hardcode a hex value or
a blur/shadow stack, route it through a token here instead.

- **Two typefaces, and mono is now rare.** `--font-sans` is Inter Variable
  (`@fontsource-variable/inter`), and the root font size is the browser default
  100% (it was 110%, which rendered the whole rem-based UI too large);
  `--font-mono` is JetBrains Mono, and it is reserved for **code, logs and
  terminal output** : `live-log-viewer.svelte`, `ansi-line.svelte`, the Terminal
  tab, System Logs, Observability → Events and Errors and the env paste box.
  Everything else — nav, labels, status badges, metrics, image refs, hostnames —
  is sans. An earlier pass made mono the UI's voice across the board and it read
  as a terminal emulator rather than an app. `tech` survives as _tabular figures
  only_ (`font-variant-numeric`), so live-updating numbers still don't reflow.
- **The design is ported from Penombre** (`orochibraru/penombre`'s
  `src/app.css`), deliberately, because that app's look is the target. Four
  things carry it:
  - **The aurora.** `body::before` paints two oversized, heavily blurred radial
    colour fields on opposite corners (`--brand-2` pink top-right, `--brand-3`
    cyan bottom-left), `filter: blur(72px) saturate(140%)`, fixed so they stay
    put while content scrolls. `html` holds the solid ground (`--color-bg`) and
    `body` is transparent, so panels above can be translucent without stacking
    washes.
  - **Film grain.** `body::after` is an inline SVG `feTurbulence` at 3.5%
    opacity, `mix-blend-mode: soft-light`. It exists so the aurora's gradient
    doesn't band; keep it subtle enough that type stays crisp.
  - **Frosted panels.** `panel` is a translucent `--color-surface` +
    `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` + hairline border. The blur is deliberately
    light : heavier turns the gradient behind a card into a visible rectangle.
    `panel-strong` is the near-opaque, heavily blurred variant for chrome that
    overlaps scrolling content (the sticky header, the mobile drawer).
  - **A violet brand.** `--color-accent` (and `--color-ink`, the fill primary
    buttons paint with) is `oklch(0.54 0.25 293)` in light, brighter in dark.
    `--radius` is `0.75rem` : soft corners, not the tightened technical ones a
    previous pass used.
- **The shell is a rail plus a floating pane.** `(protected)/+layout.svelte` is
  `flex h-screen p-2 md:gap-2`: a transparent 14rem sidebar sitting directly on
  the aurora (no panel of its own), and the page itself a `panel rounded-xl`
  pane with the sticky header inside it. The sidebar carries the one primary
  action (`Deploy a service`, full width, brand-filled) above the nav, the way
  Penombre's "New" button does.
- **Navigation up is the header's breadcrumb trail, not per-page back links.**
  `breadcrumbs.svelte` builds it from the URL: top-level segments take their
  sidebar label, an id segment takes the `name`/`label`/`title` of whichever
  `page.data` object has that `id`, anything else is the humanized segment.
  Don't add an `← Parent` link to a page; a URL prefix that isn't a real page
  goes in the layout's `skip` list. A page whose place in the hierarchy isn't
  its URL returns `crumbRoot` (a list of `{ href, label }`) from its `load` to
  stand in for the first segment: a service in a stack reads
  `Stacks › <parent stacks…> › <stack> › <service>` although its URL is
  `/services/<id>`, and a nested stack's own pages list its parents the same
  way. The pane's `<main>` is `relative` so absolutely-positioned content
  (`sr-only` spans) is contained by its scroll area instead of stretching the
  document into a second scrollbar.
- **Colours come from palettes, and they have to move more than one variable, on
  the document root.** `/profile/appearance` picks a palette
  (`src/lib/palettes.ts`: an accent plus five chart hues) or a custom accent;
  `appearanceCss` turns that into `--color-accent`, `--color-ink`, `--primary`,
  `--ring`, the `--chart-*` hues and the aurora's `--brand-2/3`, and only ever
  emits a known palette or a validated hex. Category tiles use the `chart-*`
  tokens (`TEMPLATE_CATEGORY_COLORS`), so they follow the palette too.
  Overriding only `--color-accent` leaves every button on the stock violet,
  which is exactly what "the accent switch doesn't work on buttons" meant. Two
  further traps, both real bugs that shipped:
  - **It's a `<svelte:head>` rule, not a `style=""` on the layout wrapper.**
    bits-ui portals every dialog, popover, dropdown and tooltip out to
    `document.body`, so anything rendered inside one sits outside that wrapper
    and keeps the stock colour — which is how the notification bell's link
    buttons stayed violet while the page behind them followed the picker.
  - **The selector is `:root:root`, not `:root`.** SvelteKit assembles its head
    as `[component head, style tags, stylesheet links]` (`Head.build()` in
    `@sveltejs/kit`'s `render.js`), so a `<svelte:head>` rule is emitted
    _before_ `layout.css` and loses a same-specificity tie against it. Doubling
    the selector wins on specificity instead, over both `:root` and `.dark`,
    whatever the order. `tests/e2e/ui-appearance.spec.ts` asserts the chosen hex
    reaches a portaled popover, which is the assertion that caught both.
- **`eyebrow`** is a small sans semibold label (no longer uppercase mono), used
  for panel titles and sidebar group headings. **`metric`** is the large tabular
  number on the stat tiles. **`panel-head`** is the shared card-header strip.
- Both themes are real and both are checked : light is `:root`, dark is `.dark`
  (driven by `mode-watcher`). Every token that differs between them is redefined
  in both blocks, a color defined only in one is a bug.

**`layout.css` is formatted by biome, not prettier.** Biome owns CSS here
(`biome.json`'s `css.parser`), and it indents with tabs; prettier has no
`useTabs` in `.prettierrc` and rewrites the whole file to spaces, which is a
600-line diff that nothing then checks. Run `bunx biome check --write` on it.

**Sweeping this file's tokens is how a global visual change is made**, not a
per-route pass : both redesigns so far changed ~65 files, and almost all of that
was one mechanical substitution (`border border-border bg-surface` → `glass` the
first time, `glass` → `panel` the second). **A real bug came out of doing that
with a `\b`-anchored regex**: `bg-surface\b` matches inside `bg-surface-2`,
silently producing a bogus `glass-2` class that Tailwind emits nothing for.
Match on whole class tokens, not substrings, and order the replacements
longest-first (`glass-strong` before `glass`) for the same reason. `\bglass\b`
also matches inside `--glass-highlight`, which is how a dangling
`var(--panel-highlight)` got left behind in three files : grep the CSS variable
names separately afterward.

**One list/grid component, `entity-list.svelte`.** It takes `items` (each
`{id, title, subtitle?, description?, href?}`) plus optional
`media`/`badge`/`meta`/`actions` snippets and a `selectedIds`/`onToggleSelect`
pair, and renders both the list view (one `panel`, rows separated by hairlines)
and the card view from the same data. It replaced `entity-list-view.svelte`,
which took raw `row`/`card` snippets : every page drew its own row chrome, so
each list had different padding, and once the shared container became a panel
the pages that still drew a `panel` per row showed **double borders with no gap
between items**. Services, templates, stacks and storage go through it; the
remaining five list pages (remote hosts, backup destinations, cron jobs, build
cache, git providers) still hand-roll their row internals inside the same
panel/divider shell, see `TODO.md`.

`entity-list.svelte` also takes a **`wrapper`** snippet, which the services list
uses to put every row inside a right-click `ContextMenu` (start/stop/ restart,
settings, delete, Link to…, group into a stack, ungroup) without each page
rebuilding its own row markup. The wrapper receives the item and a no-argument
body snippet; that shape is deliberate, a `Snippet<[T]>` body can't be assigned
across the generic boundary.

**The resource graphs** (`usage-chart.svelte`, `service-usage-table.svelte`)
read `stat_sample` through `src/lib/remote/stats.remote.ts`. The chart is a
plain inline SVG path over a `0 0 100 40` viewBox — no chart library, same "a
self-hosted app shouldn't need a CDN" reasoning as the bundled fonts — with
metric (CPU/memory/traffic) and range (live…all) switches, and it refreshes
itself every 5s only on the live range. `service-graph.svelte` is the service
overview's Connections diagram.

**Verify a visual change by actually looking at it.** `tests/e2e/`'s harness
boots a real app against a real Postgres (`bun run build`, then a throwaway spec
under `tests/e2e/` run with `bun run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/<name>.spec.ts`) :
sign up, click through onboarding, and screenshot the pages you touched in both
themes (set `localStorage["mode-watcher-mode"] = "dark"` and reload for the dark
pass). Delete the spec afterward. Reasoning about token values alone is how you
ship a button that turns out to be grey.

## Page width and layout

Covered as a hard rule under Conventions above, repeated here because it's a
layout decision rather than a code-style one: **dashboard pages fill the
viewport** (`p-5 md:p-6`, no `mx-auto`, no `max-w-*`). `/authentication` shipped
with `mx-auto max-w-4xl` and looked broken on an ultrawide display, with the
whole page squeezed into a centre column; `remote-hosts/[hostId]` had the same
defect (`mx-auto max-w-2xl`). Both now follow the same wrapper every other page
uses.

## Shared UI components (`src/lib/components/`)

Not a full componentized design system, this app still doesn't have one, but a
real shared list-page toolkit now exists alongside the smaller extracted
patterns: `status-badge.svelte` (pre-existing), `empty-state.svelte`
(icon/title/subtitle + optional CTA snippet, used on Storage and Remote Hosts so
far, other list pages still have their empty state inlined), `form-styles.ts`
(the `inputClass`/`labelClass`/`errorClass` Tailwind strings almost every form
page redefines identically, imported directly as class strings, not a wrapper
component, so it doesn't force a markup shape change on pages that predate it;
wired into Remote Hosts and the service Networking tab so far), `stepper.svelte`
(the step-indicator-bar-plus-Back/Next chrome and unlocked-step gating every
multi-step form needs, extracted while building the onboarding wizard, see
Onboarding below; `services/new` keeps its own `wizard-nav.svelte` since its
steps are all clickable at any time and it has two submit buttons),
`panel-header.svelte` (icon tile + eyebrow title + description + optional
trailing action, the header of most `panel` sections), `run-status-badge.svelte`
(a backup/cron run's running/success/failed state),
`git-build-fields.svelte`/`registry-fields.svelte` (shared by `services/new` and
the service's Environments & Deployments → Source section), and
`skeleton.svelte` (one pulsing placeholder block, sized by a `class` prop, the
pending branch every remote-query-backed panel renders, see Remote functions
below), `alert.svelte` (the inline banner, `error`/`warning`/ `info`/`success`,
optional `title` and `actions` snippet, `role="alert"` when it's an error —
eight pages had hand-rolled the same `border-red-200 bg-red-50 …` div before it
existed), `async-block.svelte` (pending/ready/failed over one remote query, with
a Retry, see Remote functions in `services-and-templates.md`), and
`error-boundary.svelte` (a `<svelte:boundary>` whose `failed` snippet is an
`Alert` with a **Try again** that calls `reset` — wrapped around
`{@render children()}` in `(protected)/+layout.svelte`, so a render error in any
dashboard page is a banner in the content area with the sidebar and header still
usable, instead of a blank screen). If you're touching a page with an inline
empty-state or the same three class-string literals, prefer wiring in the shared
version over copy-pasting again, but this is opportunistic, not a mandate to
refactor unrelated pages.

**Self-loading components**, the ones that fetch their own data through a remote
query rather than taking it as a prop off a route's `load` (see Remote functions
below), so a page that wants one just renders it: `host-resources.svelte` (the
dashboard's Host Resources panel, own 5s poll), `job-queue-panel.svelte`
(Scheduling's job queue, own 3s poll), `notification-bell.svelte` (the header's
feed, plus its own mutations), `git-repo-picker.svelte` (the "Browse repos"
picker, shared by `services/new` and the service's Source section, calls back
with the picked repo), and `image-check-warning.svelte` (the debounced "this
image wasn't found in its registry" warning, shared by the same two pages).

**The list-page toolkit**, used by every entity list page (services, stacks,
templates, storage, remote-hosts, s3-destinations, build-cache-registries,
users, backups):

- `entity-toolbar.svelte` is **URL-driven**, not prop-bound: it reads the
  current `q` and each filter group's value straight off `page.url.searchParams`
  and writes changes back with `goto(url, {reset: false, replace: true})`,
  debounced 300ms for the search box, clearing every page param in `pageParams`
  (default `["page"]`) on every change so a new search/filter always lands back
  on page 1. Props are `filters` (`FilterGroup[]`, each
  `{key, label, options: {label, value}[]}`), `pageParams`, `placeholder`, and a
  `trailing` snippet slot (where a page renders `ViewModeToggle`); the old
  bindable `search`/`selected` props and the exported `FilterSelection` type are
  gone, filtering moved server-side (see Server-side list pagination above), so
  there's no client state left to bind. Replaced the bespoke
  search-input-plus-category-`Drawer` that used to be inlined in the templates
  gallery only (see Built-in template catalog and gallery below); pages without
  a card view (remote-hosts, s3-destinations, build-cache-registries, users,
  backups) use it for search/filter alone, with no `trailing` snippet.
- `pagination.svelte`: Previous/Next plus "26–50 of 60 services" and "Page 2 of
  3", also URL-driven (`goto()`, same as the toolbar), rendered only when
  `total > perPage`. Takes `page`/`perPage`/`total` (a page's `PagedResult`, see
  Server-side list pagination above) plus an optional `pageParam` (default
  `"page"`) and `label`, so a page with two independent paged lists (the
  templates gallery's built-in/custom sections) can render two of these against
  two different params.
- `view-mode.svelte.ts`'s `ViewMode` class + `view-mode-toggle.svelte`: one
  page's list/card preference, persisted in `localStorage` under
  `homerun:view:<key>` (`new ViewMode("services")`, optional 2nd arg is the
  fallback mode, e.g. `new ViewMode("templates", "card")`). Deliberately its own
  module rather than living inside `entity-list.svelte`, specifically so one
  page can render several `EntityList`s sharing a single toggle (services groups
  its rows by stack, one `EntityList` per group); before this, each group
  toggled independently, a real pre-existing bug this fixes, not just a
  refactor.
- `entity-list.svelte` takes `view: ViewMode` plus an optional `cardGridClass`
  (defaults to a 3-column grid; templates passes a 4-column one). Its old
  `viewKey` string prop and its module-block `EntityViewMode` export are gone,
  that type now lives on `src/lib/view-mode.svelte.ts`. Every list page now
  renders straight from `data` (already one page, already filtered/searched)
  rather than deriving a client-side `filtered` array, and tells a true empty
  state apart from a no-match one via `data.total === 0 && !data.filtered`.
- Multi-select (services, storage): `list-selection.svelte.ts`'s `ListSelection`
  class holds the selected ids and, constructed during component init with a
  `() => visibleIds` getter, drops any id that leaves the visible page
  (paging/search/filter), so the bulk bar never submits rows you can't see.
  `select-all-row.svelte` is the select-all checkbox above the list;
  `EntityList` takes `selectedIds={selection.ids}` and
  `onToggleSelect={(id) => selection.toggle(id)}`; `bulk-action-bar.svelte` is
  the fixed bottom bar, a form posting every selected id under `idField` to
  `action`, with the page's own buttons as children (a destructive op submits
  through a hidden `name="op"` button after a `ConfirmDialog`). The page's
  `?/bulk` action returns `{ succeeded, failed }` (storage adds `skipped`: bulk
  enable only turns on volumes that already have a schedule and destination) for
  the toast.

**The signed-out surfaces** (`auth/sign-in`, `auth/sign-up`,
`auth/sign-up/confirm`, `auth/accept-invite`, `auth/error`) all render through
`auth-shell.svelte`: one `max-w-md` column centred on an otherwise empty page,
carrying `brand-mark.svelte`, then the heading block, then the form in a `panel`
card. It takes `eyebrow`/`heading`/`subheading` props plus `children` (the
form), an optional `below` snippet for content outside that card (the confirm
page's dev-bypass panel) and an optional `footer` snippet for the trailing
"Don't have an account?" line. It used to be a two-pane layout with a
product-pitch panel (highlights, a mono deploy-log card, a blurred accent blob)
filling the left half — deliberately dropped: this is a single-user self-hosted
app's login screen, nobody arriving at it needs to be sold the product.
`brand-mark.svelte` is the accent square + `homerun` mono wordmark from the
sidebar, in `sm`/`lg`; it's also the "gated by" footer on `app-auth`.
`password-field.svelte` (label + `Input` + show/hide eye toggle) and
`password-strength.svelte` (the four-bar meter over `getPasswordStrength`)
replaced the copy of that markup each of those four forms carried. The pages
that predated this also carried stale `LocalRun` branding and a hand-rolled
`inputClass`, both gone.

**Every list page now renders its rows through `entity-list.svelte`.** Remote
hosts, backup destinations, cron jobs, build cache registries and git providers
used to hand-roll their row internals inside the same panel/divider shell, which
is how they drifted : different title weights, different subtitle separators, a
status line in one and a badge in another. They map their rows to `EntityRow`
(`id`/`title`/`subtitle`/`description`/`href`) and pass the page-specific parts
as `media`/`badge`/`meta`/`actions` snippets, which is what those snippets are
for — an agent's reachability line is `meta`, a provider's Connected pill is
`badge`. They gained a card view along the way, since `EntityList` takes a
`ViewMode` either way and the toggle costs one `trailing` snippet in the
toolbar. Git providers is the one exception to that: it has no toolbar, so it
stays list-only, and its admin-only callback URL moved from a bordered line
under the row into the row's own `description`.

`confirm-dialog.svelte` gained an optional `confirmPhrase` prop: when set, the
dialog renders an input and the confirm button stays disabled until the typed
text matches the phrase exactly (Enter in the input confirms too). This replaced
the old "append a confirmation div into the section" pattern (an inline
`{#if showDeleteConfirm}` toggling a form in place) with a real modal everywhere
that pattern appeared: the service Settings danger zone and the stack detail
danger zone (typed phrase is the entity's own name), and the services list's own
per-row delete (service name) and new bulk delete (`delete N services`, see the
services list bullet below). The profile Security page's account deletion moved
into a `Dialog` too, but keeps its existing password gate instead of a typed
phrase, the password already serves that purpose. The remote-host detail page
already used `ConfirmDialog` before this and needed no change.

**Verified live** in a real browser: the toolkit's search/filter narrowing, one
`ViewMode` toggle staying in sync across a grouped list that renders several
`EntityListView`s (services' per-stack groups), select-all plus the bulk bar,
`confirmPhrase` enabling the confirm button only on an exact match, and real
single and bulk deletes. A bulk action where every service fails surfaces the
first rejection's message rather than reporting success.

## The `$derived` + push/splice anti-pattern (real, tested bug)

**Real, tested-in-review finding**: three forms, the Settings page's OAuth
Providers list, `services/new`'s env-var rows, and the service's Environment
Variables section's own rows, declared their editable row array with
`$derived(...)` and then mutated it directly
(`rows.push(...)`/`rows.splice(...)`), which is exactly why "Add provider" on
the Settings page did nothing observable (the bug that prompted this fix): a
`$derived` value is computed from its dependencies, not a mutable store, pushing
onto it doesn't reliably stick the way it would on `$state`. Fixed by converting
all three to `let rows = $state(...)` seeded once, with an `$effect` re-syncing
from the source data
(`data.settings.oauthProviders`/`data.template`/`svc.envVars`) whenever it
actually changes, not on every keystroke, so in-progress edits aren't clobbered.
`templates/new/+page.svelte`'s equivalent env-var rows already used `$state`
correctly and was the reference proving the fix, if you're adding a new
push/splice-mutated row list anywhere in this app, copy that shape (or the
now-fixed three), never `$derived`.

## Appearance preferences (`user_preferences` table, `UserPreferencesDTO`, `/profile/appearance`)

Per-account, not instance-wide (contrast `instance_settings`, which every other
"live-editable config" section in this document is about): a new "Appearance"
tab on the profile layout (`profile/+layout.svelte`, alongside Personal
Information/Security/Sessions/Authorized Clients/Notifications, the last of
which sets the event x channel matrix for Outbound notification channels, see
`observability.md`), backed by `profile/appearance/+page.server.ts`'s three
actions (`updateTheme`/`updateAccent`, each validated by its own zod schema in
`src/lib/server/validation/appearance.ts`) calling
`UserPreferencesDTO.get(userId)`'s `updateTheme`/`updateAccentColor`, which
share `InstanceSettingsDTO`'s private-`persist()` -per-section shape but
per-user instead of a singleton row.

- **Theme**: `mode-watcher` (already an installed dependency, mounted in the
  root `+layout.svelte`) was previously dead code, hardcoded to
  `<ModeWatcher defaultMode="light" />` with no UI ever exposing a way to change
  it, despite `layout.css`'s `.dark` rules already being fully built out. Now
  `<ModeWatcher />` (mode-watcher's own default, `"system"`), and the Appearance
  page's theme selector calls `setMode()` directly for an instant client-side
  preview, with the DB save (`updateTheme` action) as the durable, cross-device
  copy. `(protected)/+layout.svelte`'s `onMount` seeds a browser that has no
  `mode-watcher-mode` localStorage entry yet (a first visit on a new
  device/browser) from `data.preferences.theme`, so the account's saved choice
  follows across devices; a browser that already has its own mode-watcher entry
  is left alone, that entry owns it from then on. This is additive to, not a
  replacement for, mode-watcher's own localStorage persistence.
- **Sidebar**: no per-category colors. Every icon is `text-accent`; items are
  `font-medium`, the active one `font-semibold text-accent`. A "colorful"
  per-category mode existed and was removed as noise.
- **Lists**: the account's default page size (`updatePerPage`, validated by
  `perPageSchema` against `PER_PAGE_OPTIONS`), which every list page's `load`
  hands to `parseListQuery`, see Server-side list pagination in
  `data-and-config.md`. `pagination.svelte` has no per-page picker; `?perPage=`
  in the URL overrides it for one view.
- **Accent color**: `(protected)/+layout.svelte`'s root wrapper div gets an
  inline `style` computed from `accentColor` (a `"#rrggbb"` hex string, `null`
  meaning "use the built-in default") that overrides
  `--color-accent`/`--color-accent-light`/`--color-accent-glow` for that whole
  subtree; every `bg-accent`/`text-accent`/etc. Tailwind utility already
  references those CSS vars rather than a literal value (Tailwind v4's `@theme`
  block), so no component needs to know about the override. Scoped to
  `(protected)/` only, not pre-login pages, since this is a dashboard
  preference, not a site-wide brand color.
- **Style** (`surfaceStyle`: glass, sleek, neumorphism, boxy, clay,
  skeuomorphism, material, `src/lib/surfaces.ts`): a `data-surface` attribute on
  `<html>`, and every style is a block of token overrides in `layout.css`
  (`[data-surface="…"]`, plus a
  `.dark[data-surface="…"], .dark [data-surface="…"]` block for what differs in
  dark). `panel` reads `--panel-bg`/`--panel-bg-image`/`--panel-backdrop`/
  `--panel-border-width`/`--panel-shadow`, buttons (`[data-slot="button"]`)
  `--button-shadow`/`--button-bg-image`, and `--radius-*` are re-derived under
  `[data-surface]` so a style's `--radius` takes. It's an attribute on `<html>`,
  not a class on the layout wrapper, for the same portal reason as the accent
  CSS above. It's rendered server-side: `app.html` has
  `data-surface="%homerun.surface%"`, the protected layout's `load` sets
  `locals.surface` and `hooks.server.ts`'s `transformPageChunk` fills it in, so
  there's no flash of the default style on load; the protected layout's
  `$effect` keeps it in sync on client navigation and resets it when leaving,
  and the Appearance page sets it directly to preview. Because the selectors
  aren't `:root`-only, a `data-surface` on any element restyles its subtree,
  which is how the Appearance page's preview tiles work. A new style is one
  entry in `SURFACE_STYLES` and one token block, nothing reads the style name
  elsewhere.
- **Glass** is Apple liquid glass, and every colour in it derives from
  `--color-accent` through CSS relative colours
  (`oklch(from var(--color-accent) L C h)`): the page tint, the
  `--page-bg-image` wallpaper and the hairlines. It used to mix in the default
  `--brand-2`/`--brand-3` (pink and a hue-225 blue) and hue-290 greys, which a
  custom accent never overrides, so the default bordeaux read blue. Panels are
  `--glass-fill` plus a diagonal `--glass-sheen` at `blur(26px) saturate(190%)`,
  bordered by the bright `--glass-edge` through `--panel-border-color` (a token
  the `panel` utility reads, falling back to `--color-border`), with inset top
  and bottom highlights. `--color-border` itself is a dark translucent hairline:
  it used to be translucent white, which left every `border-border` control
  (outline buttons, segmented toggles, inputs) with no visible edge on a white
  panel. Buttons are pills; outline, secondary and destructive ones are glass
  capsules (`--glass-control` and `--glass-control-shadow`: a 0.5px dark ring, a
  white top highlight and a drop shadow). The system font comes first
  (`-apple-system`, then Inter).
- **Sleek** (`sleek`, the default since migration 0092, which also moved every
  stored `glass` to it, since a deliberate Glass pick and the old default look
  the same) is flat: the sidebar sits straight on the page with no panel of its
  own, the content is one solid panel with an accent-derived hairline and no
  shadow, outline buttons and fields are solid with the same hairline, table
  headers get a faint tint, and the page behind carries two faint accent washes.
- **Material You** (`material`) derives tonal surfaces, text and outline colours
  from the accent the same way, with no borders or shadows on panels, pill
  buttons (secondary is the tonal `--m3-tonal`), filled text fields with an
  underline, and Roboto Flex (`@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex`).
- **Presets** (`preset`, nullable: win95, win98, winxp, win7, msn, retro,
  `PRESETS` in `src/lib/surfaces.ts`) ride the same `data-surface` attribute:
  `effectiveSurface()` puts the preset there instead of the style when one is
  set, so nothing of the style leaks in, and the protected layout drops the
  palette's accent CSS. A preset block forces a whole palette (text, surfaces,
  borders, accent, `color-scheme`, `--font-sans`, `--page-bg-image` for the
  desktop behind the page) regardless of light/dark, plus the title-bar strip
  (`[data-slot="panel-header"]`/`.panel-head`, `--panel-head-bg`/`-fg`), fields
  (`--field-*`) and buttons: only `data-variant` default, outline and secondary
  get the preset's button look (the button component sets `data-variant`), ghost
  and link stay flat. The protected layout's sidebar (`data-slot="app-sidebar"`)
  becomes a window and its top bar (`data-slot="app-header"`) a title bar: the
  sidebar otherwise sits on the preset's desktop background, which made Windows
  95/98/XP unreadable. Fonts are bundled (`@fontsource`: Pixelify Sans for
  95/98, DejaVu Sans behind Tahoma for XP, Open Sans behind Segoe UI for 7 and
  MSN, VT323 for Retro, whose root font size is bumped since VT323 runs small);
  their `@font-face`s only download when a preset uses them.
  `tests/e2e/ui-appearance.spec.ts` saves every preset and checks it's
  server-rendered, leaving a screenshot of each in `test-results/`.
- `(protected)/+layout.server.ts`'s shared `load` (same one that fetches
  notifications, see above) now also fetches `UserPreferencesDTO.get(...)` and
  returns `preferences: preferences.toJSON()`, since the sidebar itself, not
  just the Appearance page, needs it on every protected render.

## Simple and advanced UI modes (`src/lib/ui-mode.ts`, `user_preferences.uiMode`, `instance_settings.defaultUiMode`)

Two ways to render the same dashboard: **simple** (homelab click-ops: short
sidebar, templates up front, engineering settings out of sight) and **advanced**
(everything). The mode only changes what's in view: it never forks a page, never
blocks a route, never changes what a service does. Operator-facing list of what
each mode shows: `docs/ui-modes.md`, keep the two in sync.

- **One definition**: `ADVANCED_ONLY` in `src/lib/ui-mode.ts`, a set of stable
  ids. Sidebar entries are keyed by their path (`/registry`), tabs and sections
  by their route under the page (`service/environments/revisions`,
  `settings/ip-bans`), blocks inside a page by `<page>#<block>`
  (`service/networking#published-ports`, `services/new#compute`). Hiding
  something new is one id there plus the `visibleIn` call where it renders;
  `tests/unit/app/ui-mode.test.ts` pins the split.
- **Resolution**: `effectiveUiMode(user, instance)`, the account's choice, else
  the instance default, else `DEFAULT_UI_MODE` (advanced, so an instance that
  never picked keeps everything visible). The `(protected)` root layout load
  returns `uiMode` (effective) and `instanceUiMode`, so every page and layout
  under it reads `data.uiMode`, no extra fetch.
- **Nav, tabs, sections**: `visibleItems(mode, items, pathname)` filters any
  `{ href, id }[]` and always keeps the item the current page sits under
  (`currentHref`, longest matching href, same rule as `section-nav.svelte`), so
  landing on a hidden page directly still highlights where you are. The sidebar
  maps each nav item to `id: item.href`; the section layouts (`environments/`,
  `observability/`, `container/`) give each section an `id`; the service and
  settings tab bars call `visibleIn` per tab (settings also keeps a tab with a
  setup warning). A new section in one of those layouts needs an `id` or
  `visibleItems` won't typecheck. In simple mode the service's Environments &
  Deployments tab links to Source, since its bare Environments section is
  hidden.
- **Page blocks**: a hidden panel that's its own form is `{#if}`'d out, but
  stays when the service already uses it (blocked paths set, published ports, a
  response cache, healthcheck overrides): hiding a setting that's in effect
  would hide why the service behaves the way it does. A field inside a shared
  form goes in `advanced-disclosure.svelte` instead (collapsed in simple mode,
  rendered inline otherwise), never `{#if}`: the form still has to submit it, or
  saving the visible fields would reset the hidden one.
- **Switching**: Profile → Appearance → Interface (`updateUiMode`, "" clears to
  follow the instance), the profile menu's one-click toggle (`setUiMode` remote
  command, allowlisted for read-only accounts in `permissions.ts` since it's a
  personal preference, followed by `refreshAll()`), Settings → General →
  Interface mode (`updateUiMode`, admin) and onboarding's Core step, which sets
  the instance default. `ui-mode-picker.svelte` is the shared radio-card picker
  for all three forms.
- **Simple-only additions**: the Overview's "Deploy an app" strip
  (`SIMPLE_FRONT_PAGE_TEMPLATES`, built-in template ids, posting to the
  templates page's `?/quickDeploy`), and the service Overview's "Roll back to
  the previous version" button (`?/rollback`,
  `RevisionService.findTarget(svc, null)`), shown only when there's a previous
  revision, since Revisions is hidden there.
