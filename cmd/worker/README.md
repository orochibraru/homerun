# Homerun worker

`homerun-worker` is the Go half of Homerun. One binary, two modes, picked by
whether `DATABASE_URL` is set:

- **Next to the app** (`DATABASE_URL` set): leases the heavy background jobs
  (deploys, builds, backups, scans, cron jobs, cleanups) from the app's Postgres
  job queue, and serves the Docker control API the app calls for everything that
  touches Docker (container status, start/stop/restart, logs, the web terminal,
  host stats, prunes, swarm). Port `7430`, bearer token derived from
  `AUTH_SECRET` on both sides. The app image ships it at
  `/usr/local/bin/homerun-worker` and the compose files run it as the `worker`
  service.
- **Agent mode** (no `DATABASE_URL`): runs on a _remote_ build host's own Docker
  daemon and serves only a small, token-authenticated HTTP surface (git builds,
  image export, host stats) for the main instance to drive. Port `7420`. It's
  wired into the app as a build-server connection kind
  (`remote_host.kind: "agent"`), see
  [`docs/remote-hosts-and-agent.md`](../../docs/remote-hosts-and-agent.md).

Agent mode deliberately doesn't expose the Docker control API: that API is exec,
a terminal and arbitrary container creation, so on a host reached over the
network a leaked token would be the whole daemon. A build host only ever needs
to be asked to build.

## Running it in agent mode on a remote host

None of these need Go or a source checkout on the target host.

**Via the installer (recommended for a fresh host).** Sets up rootless Docker
too, then installs the worker as the `homerun-worker` `systemd --user` unit, see
[`cmd/installer/README.md`](../installer/README.md):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orochibraru/homerun/main/cmd/installer/bootstrap.sh \
  | sudo bash -s -- --mode=agent
```

Its token then lives in the rootless user's `~/.homerun-worker/token`
(`sudo -u homerun cat /home/homerun/.homerun-worker/token`).

**Already running Docker your own way?** Run the published image
(`docker.io/orochibraru/homerun-worker`, `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`, built
from the `worker` stage in the root [`Dockerfile`](../../Dockerfile) via the
`worker` target in the root [`docker-bake.hcl`](../../docker-bake.hcl)),
mounting the Docker socket the same way any Docker-managing container does:

```bash
docker run -d --name homerun-worker --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 7420:7420 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v homerun-worker-token:/root/.homerun-worker \
  docker.io/orochibraru/homerun-worker:latest
```

The second volume persists the generated token across container restarts; set
`-e WORKER_TOKEN=...` instead to pin it yourself. Never pass `DATABASE_URL`
here, it would switch the container out of agent mode. Mount
`/run/user/<uid>/docker.sock` onto `/var/run/docker.sock` to drive a rootless
daemon instead of the system one.

**Grab the prebuilt binary directly** from this repo's GitHub releases (Linux
only, amd64/arm64, see `scripts/build-packages.ts`):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/orochibraru/homerun/releases/latest/download/homerun-worker-amd64.gz | gunzip -c > homerun-worker
chmod +x homerun-worker
./homerun-worker
```

(`-arm64` on an arm64 host. No macOS build: the worker only ever runs on the
Linux host it manages.)

On first boot with no `WORKER_TOKEN` set, it generates a token, persists it to
`WORKER_TOKEN_FILE` and prints it in its startup banner. Paste that, plus this
host's reachable `http://host:7420`, into the main instance's Remote Hosts page.

**From source**, from the repo root:

```bash
go run ./cmd/worker                        # agent mode, as long as DATABASE_URL is unset
bun run scripts/build-packages.ts amd64    # or arm64, writes dist/homerun-worker-<arch>
```

A stop waits up to 120 seconds in agent mode for in-flight requests (a build in
progress) before forcing the shutdown; a second SIGINT/SIGTERM forces it
immediately.

## Agent-mode HTTP surface

Every route requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` except `/v1/health` and
`/v1/openapi.json`.

- `GET /v1/health`, `{status, version}`, unauthenticated, for a load balancer or
  monitor probe.
- `GET /v1/openapi.json`, this surface's own OpenAPI document, unauthenticated.
- `GET /v1/stats`, host CPU/RAM/disk/GPU, the same shape as the main app's
  `SystemStatsService`.
- `POST /v1/build`, body is a `BuildInput` (see `internal/agent/build.go`):
  clones a git repo at a ref (a branch, tag or full commit SHA) and builds it
  into a local image with `buildMethod`: `dockerfile` (the default,
  `docker buildx build` with BuildKit, `buildTarget` picking the stage, the last
  one when unset), `bake` (`docker buildx bake`, one target of `bakeFile`,
  default `docker-bake.hcl`, `buildTarget`, default `default`), or `nixpacks`,
  `railpack`, `heroku`, `paketo`. Every method runs in a pinned `docker:cli`
  helper container with the host's Docker socket mounted, see
  `internal/agent/builders.go`. With `push`, the BuildKit layer cache is read
  from and written to that registry (`<registry>/<image>:buildcache`) and the
  image is pushed there afterward. A `commit` pins the build to that commit even
  when the branch has moved on. Returns `{success, commit?, error?}`, where a
  failed build's `error` carries its most telling output line.
- `GET /v1/images/save?ref=<image:tag>`, streams a local image as a
  `docker save` tarball (`application/x-tar`, 404 when the image isn't there).
  The main app `docker load`s it when a build server has no cache registry.
